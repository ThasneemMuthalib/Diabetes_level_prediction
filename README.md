Conducted a descriptive analysis and an advanced analysis on the Diabetes prediction dataset sourced from the Kaggle website with the objective to develop a model which will predict the diabetes level beforehand as diabetes, prediabetes or diabetes. To predict the diabetes level, a Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree classifier, XGBoost, Random Forest Classifier and KNN models were fitted on the dataset after the descriptive analysis with the use of several variables on this dataset. Except for
the Multinomial Logistic model, the rest had an accuracy varying from 0.80 to 0.85 with the original dataset and as well as with the synthetic sampled datasets. Finally, the model built using the XGBoost algorithm with an accuracy of 0.85 and 0.9 precision and recall was chosen as the best model for diabetes prediction.
